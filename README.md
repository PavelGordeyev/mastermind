# mastermind
Text-based version of the Mastermind game. 

The user will have 8 turns to guess the color and sequence of 4 pegs. 
Peg colors are represented by numbers 1-6. Each turn, they will receive feedback on the correctness of the guess that was played. 

An "X" means that it is an exact match for color and location, while a "O" is only a match for color. The results are in a random order.
